# Code Overview

The code contains the following Go types and functions:

- The `Service` interface defines the behavior of a service that can be injected into other components.
- The `RealService` struct is an implementation of the Service interface. It provides a concrete implementation of the DoSomething method.
- The `FakeService` struct is another implementation of the Service interface. It can be used as a fake service for testing purposes.
- The `Controller` struct depends on the Service interface. It has a field of type Service that will be injected with a concrete implementation.
- The `DoSomething` method of the Controller struct uses the Service interface to perform some operation and return the result as a string.
- The `main function` shows an example of how the Controller struct can be used with the RealService and FakeService implementations.

# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows components to receive their dependencies from the outside instead of creating them directly. This makes it possible to use different implementations of the dependencies in different contexts, such as during testing.

In this code, the 'Controller' struct depends on the Service interface, but it does not create an instance of the 'Service' itself. Instead, the Service is injected into the Controller by setting the Service field of the Controller struct. This allows the caller of the Controller to control which implementation of the Service is used.
