# Plannet Struct

This is a Go program that defines a Planet struct and uses it to create a slice of planets. The main function iterates over the slice and prints the name and distance of each planet.

The `Planet` struct has fields for the planet's name, mass, diameter, distance from the Sun, number of moons, and whether or not it has rings.

In the main function, the program creates a `slice` of planets and initializes it with data for several planets, including Mercury and Venus. The program then uses a for loop to iterate over the slice, and for each planet, it uses the fmt.Printf function to print a string that includes the planet's name and distance from the Sun in millions of kilometers.
