# Fibonacci Sequence

This Project Implements Chan. Reads : [GeeksForGeeks : Channel in Golang](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/channel-in-golang/)

## How it works

The program defines a function fibonacci that returns a channel that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The function creates a new goroutine that sends the next number in the sequence on the channel, and then returns the channel to the caller.

In the main function, we use a range loop to iterate over the numbers generated by the channel. The loop will continue until the channel is closed, at which point the loop will exit.
