# Polindrom Slice

This is a Go program that defines a function `isPalindrome` that takes a slice of integers as an input and returns true if the slice is a palindrome, false otherwise. A slice is a palindrome if it's elements are same when read from front and back.

In the main function, the program creates a slice of integers and then calls the `isPalindrome` function passing the slice as an argument. The function compares the elements at the start and end of the slice, moving inward, and stops when the pointers meet in the middle of the slice. If the elements at the start and end are not the same, the function returns false, indicating that the slice is not a palindrome. If all the `elements are same` when read from front and back, the function returns `true`, indicating that the slice is a palindrome.
