# Go With Me

- step-by-step guide on how to use a specific tool or library in Go, complete with code examples and explanations.

- collection of common algorithms and data structures implemented in Go, along with explanations and usage examples.

- collection of useful Go packages and libraries that can be used to build applications or solve specific problems.

# Start from here

- First, look at [roadmap.sh/golang](https://roadmap.sh/golang), after that you can see all [golang keywords](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/GoKeywords)

- Then, you can start with [NumberIdentifier](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/NumberIdentifier), [FizzBuzz_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/FizzBuzz_1), [FizzBuzz_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/FizzBuzz_2), [Fibonacci_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Fibonacci_1).

- To continue, you must understand more `looping style` in Go. You can read [5 basic for loop patterns](https://yourbasic.org/golang/for-loop/).

- Next will be [MinMaxSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/MinMaxSlice), [ReverseSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/ReverseSlice), [PolindromeSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PolindromeSlice), inhere you will understanding slice.

- Next, if you want understand what is `Recursive Function`, you can learn from [Fibonacci_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Fibonacci_2), [Factorial](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Factorial), [Pow](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Pow). `Recursive` is confusing to understand, you can watch this [How Recursion Works? - Explained with animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeOE1qMyRA&ab_channel=LiveToCode)

- If you can't understand `Recursive`, it's okey, you can continue to understand struct and pointer. Here you go [PlanetStruct](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PlanetStruct), [StructCircle](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/StructCircle), [PointerToStruct](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PointerToStruct), [ImplementationObjectOriented](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/ImplementationObjectOriented).

- If you understand `pointer` properly, you can continue to [CRUD_Contact_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/CRUD_Contact_1) and [CRUD_Contact_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/CRUD_Contact_2).

- At this point, you should understand if-else & swicth-case statement, looping, slice, struct, pointer and recursive. At this point, you free to explore more about TCP/IP & HTTP/S or Regex or DS-Queue/DS-Stack or CRUD or even Dependency Injection.
