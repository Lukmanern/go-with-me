# Go With Me

- Learning Go Code by Example.

# The way (core) i learn Go is :

- Loop styles

- Recursive (to understand what is stacking and `StackOverFlow`)

- Struct

- Pointer

- OOP and Dependency Injection

- Web/ HTTP/ net package

- Database // you can see [my simple project](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-supabase)

- Go for Microservice : Gin/ ECHO

# Start from here

- First, look at [roadmap.sh/golang](https://roadmap.sh/golang), after that you can see all [golang keywords/ syntax](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/GoKeywords)

- Then, you can start with [NumberIdentifier](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/NumberIdentifier), [FizzBuzz_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/FizzBuzz_1), [FizzBuzz_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/FizzBuzz_2), [Fibonacci_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Fibonacci_1).

- To `continue`, you must understand more/ all `looping styles` in Go. You can read : [5 basic for loop patterns](https://yourbasic.org/golang/for-loop/).

- Next will be [MinMaxSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/MinMaxSlice), [ReverseSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/ReverseSlice), [PolindromeSlice](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PolindromeSlice), inhere you will understanding slice.

- Next, if you want understand what is `Recursive Function`, you can learn from [Fibonacci_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Fibonacci_2), [Factorial](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Factorial), [Pow](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/Pow). For first time, `Recursive` is confusing to understand, you can watch this [How Recursion Works? - Explained with animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNeOE1qMyRA&ab_channel=LiveToCode)

- If you can't understand `Recursive` (try to learn in the next day), it's okey, you can continue to understand struct and pointer. Here you go [PlanetStruct](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PlanetStruct), [StructCircle](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/StructCircle), [PointerToStruct](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/PointerToStruct), [ImplementationObjectOriented](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/ImplementationObjectOriented).

- If you understand `pointer` properly, you can continue to [CRUD_Contact_1](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/CRUD_Contact_1) and [CRUD_Contact_2](https://github.com/Lukmanern/go-with-me/tree/master/CRUD_Contact_2).

- At this point, you should understand `if-else` & `swicth-case statement`, `loop styles`, `slice`, `struct`, `pointer` and `recursive func`. What next is, you free to explore more about TCP/IP & HTTP/S or Regex or DS-Queue/DS-Stack or CRUD or even Dependency Injection.

- Try to understand how clean code and package is work in Go, it's important.

- Must read blog/s (i guess) : [Build a Blog With Go Templates](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2022/11/08/build-a-blog-with-go-templates/), [Testing in Go](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2022/11/22/comprehensive-guide-to-testing-in-go/), [A Journey With Go](https://medium.com/a-journey-with-go), [Digital Oceanâ€™s Go Series](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go).
