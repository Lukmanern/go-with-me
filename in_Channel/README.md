# CHANNEL

### In Go, a channel is a type that allows you to send and receive values between goroutines (concurrent function executions). Channels are a way for goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

### You can think of a channel as a pipeline that connects two goroutines. One goroutine can send a value to the channel, and another goroutine can receive that value from the channel. This allows you to pass data between goroutines and synchronize their execution.
